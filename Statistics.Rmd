# Introduction to Statistics

## What is Statistics?

* Statistics is the collection, organizing and analysing of data.

## Is Data Science Statistics in Disguise?

* Unlike Statistics, Data Science is an interdisciplinary field consisting of Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science and Domain Knowledge.

## Types of Data

* Data can be classified into two types  
  - Based on Measurement scale  
  - Based on Time Period  

## Based on Measurement Scale
* Qualitative Data  
  - Nominal Data e.g sex
  - Ordinal Data e.g temperature level; High, Medium and Low
* Quantitative Data  
  - Ratio  e.g weight
  - Interval e.g temperature in degreee celsius

## Based on Time Period
* Cross-Sectional Data e.g number of viewers for different youtube genres in the year 2021
* Time Series Data e.g number of viewers for Sport channels on youtube from the year 2014-Date.

## Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean

* Sum of all values of observations divided by the number of observations
* Mathematically denoted as:  
  $\bar a = \dfrac{\sum_{i}^{n}x_{i}}{n}$
* Sensitive to extreme or high values

### Median
* Center of an ordered observations
* Also known as the middle of the observations.
* Not sensitive to extreme values

### Mode
* Observation with the highest number of occurence.

## Measures of Variation

### Standard Deviation and Variance

* Measures how far an observation is from the mean
* Mathematically defined as:  
$s = \sqrt{\dfrac{\sum_{i}^{n}(x_{i}-\bar x)}{n}}$
* Variance is defined as the square of the standard deviation:  
$Variance = s^2$

### Range
* Difference between the largest and smallest observations.
* Sensitive to extreme values

### Percentiles
* Expressing the sorted observations in percentage
* Not sensitive to extreme values

## Interquartile Range
* The interquartile range divides the observations into 4 equal part:
  - First Quartile: Q1
  - Second Quratile: Q2 (median)
  - Third Quratile: Q3
