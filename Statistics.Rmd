# Introduction to Statistics and Statistical Measures

## What is Statistics?

* Statistics is the collection, organizing and analysing of data.

## Is Data Science Statistics in Disguise?

* Unlike Statistics, Data Science is an interdisciplinary field consisting of Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science and Domain Knowledge.

## Types of Data

* Data can be classified into two types  
  - Based on Measurement scale  
  - Based on Time Period  

## Based on Measurement Scale
* Qualitative Data  
  - Nominal Data e.g sex
  - Ordinal Data e.g temperature level; High, Medium and Low
* Quantitative Data  
  - Ratio  e.g weight
  - Interval e.g temperature in degreee celsius

## Based on Time Period
* Cross-Sectional Data e.g number of viewers for different youtube genres in the year 2021
* Time Series Data e.g number of viewers for Sport channels on youtube from the year 2014-Date.

## Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean

* Sum of all values of observations divided by the number of observations
* Mathematically denoted as:  
  $\bar a = \dfrac{\sum_{i}^{n}x_{i}}{n}$
* Sensitive to extreme or high values

### Median
* Center of an ordered observations
* Also known as the middle of the observations.
* Not sensitive to extreme values

### Mode
* Observation with the highest number of occurence.

## Measures of Variation

### Standard Deviation and Variance

* Measures how far an observation is from the mean
* Mathematically defined as:  
$s = \sqrt{\dfrac{\sum_{i}^{n}(x_{i}-\bar x)}{n}}$
* Variance is defined as the square of the standard deviation:  
$Variance = s^2$

### Range
* Difference between the largest and smallest observations.
* Sensitive to extreme values

### Percentiles
* Expressing the sorted observations in percentage
* Not sensitive to extreme values

## Interquartile Range
* The interquartile range divides the observations into 4 equal part:
  - First Quartile: Q1
  - Second Quratile: Q2 (median)
  - Third Quratile: Q3

# Probability and Probability Distributions

## What is probability

* It is simply the study of uncertainty.
* Example the possibility of raining, tossing a coin or rolling a die.
* It is the measuring of how likely an event will occur.
* Mathematically defined as:
$Probability = \dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}}$


## Terms in Probability

* Experiment: An uncertain situation e.g tossing a coin
* Outcome: Result of a trial in an experiment.
* Event: One or more outcome from a experiment
* Sample Space: The collection of possible outcomes of an experiment.

## Random Variable

* Outcome of an event expressed in numbers
* For example in the coin toss experiment we can either have a head or tail which can be numerically expressed as 1 or 0 respectively.
* Let's call a set containing these two numbers X where;
`X = {1,0}`.
* `X` represents the Random Variable
* What's the random variable of a sixed face die?

## The Two Coin Toss Experiment


* S = {HH,HT,TH,TT}  
$Probability = \dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}}$
* Number of possible outcomes = 4
* Probability of getting a head in both coins is:
$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(HH)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes(HH,HT,TH,TT)}}= \dfrac{1}{4}$
* Probability of getting a head in the first coin and a tail in the second coin:  
$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(HT)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes(HH,HT,TH,TT)}} = \dfrac{1}{4}$
* Probability of getting a head and a tail in both coins.  
$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(HT,TH)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes(HH,HT,TH,TT)}} = \dfrac{2}{4}$


## The Two Die Experiment

![Tabular representation of the sample space of rolling two die ]("C:\Users\User\Documents\Statistics\image\die.png")

## The Two Die Experiment

* S = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),...,(6,6)}  
$Probability = \dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}}$
* Number of possible outcomes = 36
* Probability of getting a `one` in both die:
$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(1,1)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}}= \dfrac{1}{36}$
* Probability of getting a `one` in the first die and a `two` in the second die:
$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(1,2)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}} = \dfrac{1}{36}$
* Probability of getting a one and a two: 
$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(1,2) or (2,1)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}} = \dfrac{2}{36}$

## The Two Die Experiment

## Bernoulli Distribution

* A single trial with only two possible outcomes is called as binomial distribution.
* Example is a coin tossed once or a fight between me and Mayowa(DevNet) where the probability of I winning is 0.9 and him losing is 0.1.

## Distribution of a Bernoulli Experiment

## Binomial Distribution

* Unlike the Bernoulli Distribution, the binomial distribution has `n` number of trials.
* A distribution is said to be Binomial if the following are satisfied;
  - A trial with two outcomes and repeated `n` number of trials
  - Each trial is independent 
  - A total numbers of `n` trials are conducted
  - The probability of success and failure is same for all trials.

## Normal Distribution

* A distribution is said to be normally distributed if it satisfies the following conditions;
  - The mean, median and mode of the distribution are the same.
  - The curve of the distribution is bell shaped
  - Half of the value are left of the center and the other half at the right.

## Central Limit Theorem

* Regardless of the distribution of a variable's population, if we have a sufficiently large sample size, the mean and standard deviation of that variable will be normally distributed.
