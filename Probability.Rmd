## What is Probability

* It is simply the study of uncertainty.
* Example the possibility of raining, tossing a coin or rolling a die.
* It is the measuring of how likely an event will occur.
* Mathematically defined as:
$Probability = \dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}}$


## Terms in Probability

* **Experiment:** An uncertain situation e.g tossing a coin
* **Outcome:** Result of a trial in an experiment.
* **Event:** One or more outcome from a experiment
* **Sample Space:** The collection of possible outcomes of an experiment.

## Random Variable

* Outcome of an event expressed in numbers
* For example in the coin toss experiment we can either have a **Head** or **Tail** which can be numerically expressed as **1** or **0** respectively.
* Let's call a set containing these two numbers **X** where;  
**X = {1,0}**.
* **X** represents the Random Variable
* What's the random variable of a Six face die?

## The Two Coin Toss Experiment

## The Two Coin Toss Experiment

* **S = {HH,HT,TH,TT}** 

$Probability = \dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}}$

* Number of possible outcomes = 4
* Probability of getting a head in both coins is:

$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(HH)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes(HH,HT,TH,TT)}}= \dfrac{1}{4}$

* Probability of getting a head in the first coin and a tail in the second coin:  

$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(HT)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes(HH,HT,TH,TT)}} = \dfrac{1}{4}$

* Probability of getting a head and a tail in both coins.  

$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(HT,TH)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes(HH,HT,TH,TT)}} = \dfrac{2}{4}$


## The Two Die Experiment

## The Two Die Experiment

* **S = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),...,(6,6)}**  

$Probability = \dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}}$

* Number of possible outcomes = 36
* Probability of getting a `one` in both die:

$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(1,1)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}}= \dfrac{1}{36}$

* Probability of getting a `one` in the first die and a `two` in the second die:

$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(1,2)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}} = \dfrac{1}{36}$

* Probability of getting a one and a two: 

$=\dfrac{\text{Number of Required outcomes(1,2) or (2,1)}}{\text{Number of Possible outcomes}} = \dfrac{2}{36}$

## The Two Die Experiment

## The Candy Jar

* A Candy Jar has 11 candies, **5 Green** candies, **2 Yellow** candies and **4 Red** candies. 
1. If your  sibling wants a candy what is the probability of you picking a **Green** Candy.
2. If your sibling **rejects** the Green candy, and decides he wants **Two Yellow** Candies what's the probability.
3. If you want a **Green** and a **Red** Candy whats the probability of you picking.  
*Note all these scenarios are in order*

## The Candy Jar

* Number of Candies = 11

* $\text{Probability of Selecting Green}=\dfrac{5}{11}$

* $\text{Probability of Selecting Yellow}=\dfrac{2}{11}$

* $\text{Probability of Selecting Red}=\dfrac{4}{11}$

## The Candy Jar

1. Probability of Green Candy
$=\dfrac{5}{11}$

2. Probability of Two Yellow Candy given the Green Candy is returned
$=\dfrac{2}{11}\times\dfrac{1}{10}=\dfrac{1}{55}$

3. Probability of Green Candy and a Red Candy given no more Yellow Candy
$=\dfrac{5}{9}\times\dfrac{4}{8}=\dfrac{5}{18}$

## Bernoulli Distribution

* A single trial with only two possible outcomes is called as Bernoulli distribution.
* Example is a coin tossed once or a fight between me and Mayowa(DevNet) where the probability of I winning is **0.9** and him losing is **0.1.**

## Distribution of a Bernoulli Experiment

## Binomial Distribution

* Unlike the Bernoulli Distribution, the binomial distribution has **n** number of trials.
* A distribution is said to be Binomial if the following are satisfied;
  - A trial with two outcomes and repeated **n** number of trials
  - Each trial is independent 
  - A total numbers of **n** trials are conducted
  - The probability of **Success** and **Failure** is same for all trials.

## Normal Distribution

* A distribution is said to be normally distributed if it satisfies the following conditions;
  - The **Mean, Median and Mode** of the distribution are the same.
  - The curve of the distribution is bell shaped
  - Half of the value are left of the center and the other half at the right.
  
## Normal Distribution

## Central Limit Theorem

* Regardless of the distribution of a variable's population, if we have a sufficiently large sample size, the mean and standard deviation of that variable will be approximately normally distributed.

## Central Limit Theorem

## Challenge

* Use the table below to answer the following questions.
```{r,echo = FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot2::diamonds |> 
  dplyr::group_by(cut) |> 
  dplyr::count(cut)
```
* Imagine you are to pick a diamond from a virtual box online, what is the probability of you picking a **Premium** diamond?
* If you are to pick two **Premium** diamonds what is the probability?
